Description
===========

Installs and configures the Cloudkick Agent, and integrates it with Chef.

Requirements
============

Requires Chef 0.10.10+

* `chef_gem` in default recipe
* `default_action` in check and monitor LWRPs

Requires Ohai 0.6.12+ for `node['platform_family']`.

Platform
--------

Platform families Debian, RHEL and Fedora are supported in the general
sense, though not all may have appropriate Cloudkick packages
available upstream.

Cookbooks
---------

* apt
* yum

The `apt_repository` and `yum_repository` LWRPs are used from these
cookbooks to create the proper repository entries so the Cloudkick
agent can be downloaded and installed.

Attributes
==========

The `/etc/cloudkick.conf` is built using these attribute values:

* `node['cloudkick']['oauth_key']` - the OAuth key used for
  authentication with the Cloudkick API.
* `node['cloudkick']['oauth_secret']` - the OAuth secret used for
  authentication with the Cloudkick API.
* `node['cloudkick']['node_name']` - host name for the Cloudkick dashboard,
  taken from ohai `node[:hostname]` by default.
* `node['cloudkick']['additional_tags']` - additional Cloudkick tags,
  added to the tags taken automatically from Role names.
* `node['cloudkick']['local_plugins_path']` - path to a directory containing custom agent plugins,
  defaults to `/usr/lib/cloudkick-agent/plugins`, the same as Cloudkick.
* `node['cloudkick']['data']` - data for the Cloudkick API about the
  node.

Resources & Providers
=====================

This cookbook contains two Resource Providers:

* `cloudkick_check` - For creating & manipulating Cloudkick Checks.
* `cloudkick_monitor` - For creating & manipulating Cloudkick Monitors.

## Example Usage:

* Create a Cloudkick Monitor for all of our appservers:

    cloudkick_monitor "appserver monitor" do
      oauth_key 'xxx'
      oauth_secret 'yyy'
      query 'tag:appserver'
      action :create
    end

* Create a Cloudkick Check for the root partition on our appservers:

    cloudkick_check "root check" do
      oauth_key 'xxx'
      oauth_secret 'yyy'
      code 51 # 'DISK'
      details({:path => '/', :fs_critical => 99, :fs_warn => 95})
      monitor_id 'q1234'
      action :create
    end

Usage
=====

In order for the agent to function, you'll need to have defined your Cloudkick API key and secret.  We recommend you do this in a Role, which should also take care of applying the cloudkick::default recipe.

Assuming you name the role 'cloudkick', here is the required json:

    {
      "name": "cloudkick",
      "chef_type": "role",
      "json_class": "Chef::Role",
      "default_attributes": {
        "cloudkick": {
          "additional_tags": [ "agent" ],      # Optional.
          "node_name": "YOUR UNIQUE HOSTNAME"  # Optional.
        }
      },
      "description": "Configures Cloudkick",
      "run_list": [
        "recipe[cloudkick]"
      ],
      "override_attributes": {
        "cloudkick": {
          "oauth_key": "YOUR KEY HERE"
          "oauth_secret": "YOUR SECRET HERE"
        }
      }
    }

If you want Cloudkick installed everywhere, we recommend you just add the cloudkick attributes to a base role.

All of the data about the node from Cloudkick is available in node['cloudkick'] - for example:

    "cloudkick": {
      "oauth_key": "YOUR KEY HERE",
      "oauth_secret": "YOUR SECRET HERE",
      "data": {
        "name": "slice204393",
        "status": "running",
        "ipaddress": "173.203.83.199",
        "provider_id": "padc2665",
        "tags": [
          "agent",
          "cloudkick"
        ],
        "agent_state": "connected",
        "id": "n87cfc79c5",
        "provider_name": "Rackspace",
        "color": "#fffffff"
      }
    }

Of particular interest is the inclusion of the Cloudkick tags.  This will allow you to search Chef via tags placed on nodes within Cloudkick:

    $ knife search node 'cloudkick_data_tags:agent' -a fqdn
    {
      "rows": [
        {
          "fqdn": "slice204393",
          "id": "slice204393"
        }
      ],
      "start": 0,
      "total": 1
    }

We automatically add a tag for each Role applied to your node.  For example, if your node had a run list of:

    "run_list": [ "role[webserver]", "role[database_master]" ]

The node will automatically have the 'webserver' and 'database_master' tags within Cloudkick.
