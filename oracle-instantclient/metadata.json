  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nThis cookbook is used to configure a system with the Oracle Instant Client and, optionally, SQL*Plus. The primary objective is to let you interact with remote Oracle servers easily.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nYou must download the RPMs in advance from Oracle yourself and accept the EULA. The RPMs must be placed on a server that can serve it up over HTTP, and you must set the URLs to the Instant Client and SQL*Plus RPMs.\n\n## Platforms\n\nOnly tested with:\n\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6\n\nand variants (Oracle Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Scientific)\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nAdd the default recipe to your run list. This will install just Instant Client.\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n* `node['oracle-instantclient']['public-url']` - The URL of where you are hosting the RPMs\n* `node['oracle-instantclient']['sqlplus-rpm']` - The filename of the SQL*Plus RPM\n* `node['oracle-instantclient']['basic-rpm']` - The filename of the basic Instant Client RPM\n\nRecipes\n=======\n\ndefault\n-------\n\nThe default recipe installs only the basic Instant Client.\n\nsqlplus\n-------\n\nThe sqlplus recipe will install both the Instant Client and SQL*Plus.\n\nBugs\n====\n\n`sqlplus` (or `sqlplus64` if you're on a 64-bit platform) doesn't work out of the box without setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.\n\nAuthor and License\n==================\n\n- Author:: Julian C.
