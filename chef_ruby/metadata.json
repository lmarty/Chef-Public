  "long_description": "# chef_ruby\n\nInstalls Ruby 1.9.x from source.\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nRVM in conjunction with Chef is shit.\n\n\n## Cookbook Requirements\n\n* apt\n* build-essential\n\n\n## Attributes\n\n* `default[:chef_ruby][:version] = \"1.9.3-p194\"`: string containing the ruby version you want to install.\n* `default[:chef_ruby][:rubygems][:version] = \"1.8.25\"`: string containing the rubygems version you want to install.\n\n\n## Recipes\n\n* `default`: installs Ruby from source.\n\n\n## Usage\nWhen setting up a system for the first time, Ohai will profile it and then store the ruby directory as `/opt/chef/embedded/lib/ruby`.\nThis attribute (normally referenced in cookbooks as `languages[:ruby][:gems_dir]`) does not get reset automatically when a new Ruby is\ninstalled. The default recipe tells Ohai to reload its attributes. Adding this block to any recipe that uses the attribute `languages[:ruby][:gems_dir]`;\nthen, whenever Ohai reloads its attributes, your cookbook will also reload its attributes.\n\n```ruby\nruby_block \"reload_ruby\" do\n  block do\n    node.load_attribute_by_short_filename('<filename of attributes, eg default>', '<name of cookbook that contains the attributes>')\n  end\n\n  action :nothing\n  subscribes :create, \"ohai[reload]\", :immediately\nend\n```\n\n\n## Legal\n\nThis cookbook was originally written by [Carlo Zottmann](http://github.com/carlo/) but he seems to have stopped maintaining it. Now it is maintained\nby Lytro.\n* Written by [Anuj Biyani](https://github.com/anujbiyani) for [Lytro](https://github.com/lytro)\n* Liability in case of anything: definitely not me.\n* License: [WTFPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL).\n",
