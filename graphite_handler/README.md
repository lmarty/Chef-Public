plugin installed, it will also send package statistics to graphite.

* `node['chef_client']['handler']['graphite']['port']` - The graphite server port.
* `node['chef_client']['handler']['graphite']['prefix']` - The prefix appended to statistics sent to graphite. Defaults to `"chef.#{node.chef_environment}.node.#{node['hostname']}"`.

Usage
